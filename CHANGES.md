## 0.0.32

*   Connectors now create organizations, datasets, and distributions with IDs prefixed by the type of record and by the ID of the connector. For example, `org-bom-Australian Bureau of Meteorology` is the organization with the ID `Australian Bureau of Meteorology` from the connector with ID `bom`. Other type prefixes are `ds` for dataset and `dist` for distribution. This change avoids conflicting IDs from different sources.
*   Fixed a race condition in the registry that could lead to an error when multiple requests tried to create/update the same record simultaneously, which is fairly common when creating organizations in the CSW connector.
*   Updated hooks so that each hook when running can skip over irrelevant events
*   Made sure hook processing resumes when either the registry or the sleuther wakes back up.
*   SA1 regions are no longer named after the SA2 region that contains them, reducing noise in the region search results. To find an actual SA1, users will need to search for its ID.
*   The broken link sleuther now has its retry count for external links configurable separately to the retry count for contacting the registry, with a default of 3.
*   Connectors now tag datasets that they've created with a `sourcetag` attribute - at the end of a crawl, they delete all records that were created by them without the latest `sourceTag`.
*   Optimised the query that finds new events for each webhook
*   Stopped async webhooks posting `success: false` on an uncaught failure, as this just causes them to process the same data and fail over and over.
*   Stopped the broken link sleuther from failing completely when it gets a string that isn't a valid URL - now records as "broken".
